' A common pitfall - The size of user-defi ned types
' There is a common pitfall that, to my surprise, is hardly ever mentioned.

' Many API-Functions that need a user defined Type (=UDT) passed as one of their arguments expect to be
' informed about the size of that type. This usually happens either by the size being stored in a member
' inside the structure or passed as a separate argument to the function.

' Frequently developers use the Len-Function to determine the size of the type. That is incorrect,
' but it usually works on the 32-bit platform - by pure chance. Unfortunately,
' it frequently fails on the 64-bit platform.

' To understand the issue, you need to know two things about Window’s inner workings.

' The members of user-defined types are aligned sequentially in memory. One member after the other.
' Windows manages its memory in small chunks. On a 32-bit system, these chunks are always 4 bytes big.
' On a 64-bit system, these chunks have a size of 8 bytes.
' If several members of a user-defined type fit into such a chunk completely, they will be stored in
' just one of those. If a part of such a chunk is already filled and the next member in the structure
' will not fit in the remaining space, it will be put in the next chunk and the remaining space in
' the previous chunk will stay unused. This process is called padding.

' Regarding the size of user-defined types, the Windows API expects to be told the complete size the
' type occupies in memory. Including those padded areas that are empty but need to be considered to
'manage the total memory area and to determine the exact positions of each of the members of the type.

' The Len-Function adds up the size of all the members in a type, but it does not count the empty
'memory areas, which might have been created by the padding. So, the size computed by the Len-Function
'is not correct! - You need to use the LenB-Function to determine the total size of the type in memory.

' Here is a small sample to illustrate the issue:


' Public Type SmallType
'     a As Integer
'     b As Long
'     x As LongPtr
' End Type

' Public Sub testTypeSize()

'     Dim s As SmallType
    
'     Debug.Print "Len: " & Len(s)
'     Debug.Print "LenB: " & LenB(s)

' End Sub
' On 32-bit the Integer is two bytes in size but it will occupy 4 bytes in memory because the Long is put
' in the next chunk of memory. The remaining two bytes in the first chunk of memory are not used. The size
' of the members adds up to 10 bytes, but the whole Type is 12 bytes in memory.

' Memory layout of user defined type in 32-bit VBA/Windows
' On 64-bit the Integer and the Long are 6 bytes total and will fit into the first chunk together.
' The LongPtr (now 8 bytes in size) will be put into the next chunk of memory and once again the remaining
' two bytes in the first chunk of memory are not used. The size of the members adds up to 14 bytes, but the
' whole type is 16 bytes in memory.

' Memory layout of user defined type in 64-bit VBA/Windows
' So, if the underlying mechanism exists on both platforms, why is this not a problem with API calls on 32-bit? –
' It is, but simply by pure chance it is unlikely you are affected by the problem. There are relatively
' few user defined types using a datatype smaller than a DWORD (Long) As a member and I don’t know any that
' also use the size/length of the UDT structure.

' Note for VBA 7 64 Bit shows the offset for SAFEARRAYBOUNDS[0...] at +24 Dec, +18 hex due to the 8-byte memory address for pvData and padding.
' I hope that helps further explain what exactly any of the SafeArray functions are performing and wherein the SafeArray structure items are located. If anyone is manually manipulating SafeArray structures be careful of any padding and getting your offsets correct.
' I'll also try and get around to your query regarding VT_I4(3) or VT_R4(4).
' There's definitely something extra going on in VBA then what the SafeArray.c functions are performing as from testing using SafeArrayDescriptorEx to create an initialized empty Integer Array the cbElements weren't set, the preceding VT was set. Strangely the VBA integer Array still worked without the cbElements set to 2 bytes for an Integer Array. When creating the SafeArrayDescriptor I now set the cbElements, manually.
' When created using the above VBA example the cbElements were set appropriately.
' In the SafeArray.c functions they aren't returning a SizeOf(VT_I4) or SizeOf(VT_R4) i.e. not supported in C, so I assume in VBA must expanding on the SafeArray.c functions and catering for its data types not covered in C.
' Someone more with more knowledge of C might be able to clarify or explain better.

'    FADF_VARIANT = 0x0800
'  } ADVFEATUREFLAGS;
' FADF_RECORD: The SAFEARRAY MUST contain elements of a UDT (see section 2.2.28.1)
' FADF_HAVEIID: The SAFEARRAY MUST contain MInterfacePointers elements.
' FADF_HAVEVARTYPE: If this bit flag is set, the high word of the cLocks field of the SAFEARRAY MUST contain a VARIANT type constant that describes the type of the array's elements (see sections 2.2.7 and 2.2.30.10).

' If FADF_RECORD is set, it returns VT_RECORD;
' if FADF_DISPATCH is set, it returns VT_DISPATCH;

' SafeArrayGetVartype can fail to return VT_UNKNOWN for SAFEARRAY types that are based on IUnknown. Callers should additionally check whether the SAFEARRAY type's fFeatures field has the FADF_UNKNOWN flag set.

' that describes the Type of the array's elements (see sections 2.2.7 and 2.2.30.10). The MS documentation does claim this bizzare cLocks
' requirement. However, VBA never does this with the SAFEARRAYS it creates.
' Instead it utilzes the 4 bytes at the offset of -4 (the same byes reserved for FADF_RECORD) to store the VARIANT Type constant...
' and it does this even when fFeatures bit-field does not include FADF_HAVEVARTYPE. It's frustrating, but VBA does it diff. –

' These functions insert or extract a single array element. You pass one of these functions an array pointer and an array of indexes for the element you want to access. It returns a pointer to a single element through the pvElem parameter. You also need to know the number of dimensions and supply an index array of the right size. The rightmost (least significant) dimension should be aiIndex[0] and the leftmost dimension should be aiIndex[psa->cDims-1]. These functions automatically call SafeArrayLock and SafeArrayUnlock before and after accessing the element. If the data element is a BSTR, VARIANT, or object, it is copied correctly with the appropriate reference counting or allocation. During an assignment, if the existing element is a BSTR, VARIANT, or object, it is cleared correctly, with the appropriate release or free before the new element is inserted. You can have multiple locks on an array, so it's OK to use these functions while the array is locked by other operations.

' Example:

' // Modify 2-D array with SafeArrayGetElement and SafeArrayGetElement.
' long ai[2];
' Integer iVal;
' xMin = aDims[0].lLbound;
' xMax = xMin + (int)aDims[0].cElements - 1;
' yMin = aDims[1].lLbound; 
' yMax = yMin + (int)aDims[1].cElements - 1;
' for (x = xMin; x <= xMax; x++) {
'     ai[0] = x;
'     for (y = yMin; y <= yMax; y++) {
'         ai[1] = y;
'         if (hres = SafeArrayGetElement(psaiInOut, ai, &iVal)) throw hres;
'         // Equivalent to: aiInOut(x, y) = aiInOut(x, y) + 1.
'         iVal++;
'         if (hres = SafeArrayPutElement(psaiInOut, ai, &iVal)) throw hres;
'     }
' }
